# Legal Analytics Prototype Jam

* MIT and Thomson Reuters Labs got together to hack the Legal Analytics Prototype Jam for the ABA Business Law Section.  We prototyped a dashboard to understand jurisdictional issues of cloud contracts.  The use case we chose is a tool to help small businesses understand their exposures to the new EU privacy law by automatically analyzing cloud contracts.
