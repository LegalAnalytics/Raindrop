    your use of the site and service
  
  
    
      to use zapier, you must agree you won't use zapier to break any local laws. you can't republish or resell zapier. please do not hack us (seriously, if you find a security problem, check out our bug bounty program).

      you can use zapier but that doesn't mean you can copy or redistribute our intellectual property (like our trademarks, name, logo, source code, etc). again, you have to follow your local laws when using zapier.

      zapier has a lot of user-submitted content (like our support forums, developer platform, and zap templates). by uploading content to zapier, you are effectively transfering ownership of that content to us. we may moderate this content or remove it at our discretion. sometimes we will access your content in order to provide support or technical assistance.

      please note that zapier does not receive any rights in any information or data from your accounts with third party services (i.e., gmail or dropbox) that is passed through or is processed by zapier, unless you choose to make it publically available on zapier.

      backup your content! we do our absolute best to ensure against data loss but we can't guarantee against it. it is always a good practice to regularly backup your data, regardless of whether you use zapier. we encrypt everything where possible, but there may be times when data is communicated insecurely (for example email or an unencrypted api we work with).

      our terms of service are effectively a contract between you and zapier so make sure you read them.

      we feature partners and reviews on our website. we will ask your permission before using your name or photo. we normally contact people via email to obtain their permission.
    
    
      (a) account and use of service:  you may use your user account for the service only in accordance with these terms of service and  only for lawful purposes.  you are responsible for your own communications, including the upload, transmission and posting of information, and are responsible for the consequences of their posting on or through the service. 

      (b) fees: some features of the service may only be accessed and used upon the payment of applicable fees (“fees”).  fees may vary depending on usage in accordance with our current pricing policy. if you do not initially register for a version of the service that requires the payment of a fee, you will nonetheless be permitted to use all of the features of the service for a period of fourteen (14) days (“free trial period”).  upon the expiration of the free trial period, you will only be able to access and use those features of the service the use of which does not require the payment of a fee, unless you subsequently upgrade to a paid version of the service. all fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only united states (federal or state) taxes.

      (c) refunds, upgrading and downgrading: refunds are processed according to our fair refund policy. any upgrade or downgrade in your service use will result in the new fees being charged at the next billing cycle. there will be no prorating for downgrades in between billing cycles. downgrading your service may cause the loss of features or capacity of your user account. zapier does not accept any liability for such loss.

      (d) cancellation and termination: you are solely responsible for properly canceling your user account. an email or phone request to cancel your user account is not considered cancellation. you can cancel your user account at any time by clicking on the settings link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. the settings screen provides a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link. if you cancel your user account before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. but there will not be any prorating of unused time in the last billing cycle.

      (e) prohibited conduct: zapier specifically prohibits any use of the site or the service for: (i) posting any (1) information which is incomplete, false, inaccurate or not your own, (2) trade secrets or material that is copyrighted or otherwise owned by a third party unless you have a valid license from the owner which permits you to post it, (3) material that infringes on any other intellectual property, privacy or publicity right of another, (4) advertisement, promotional materials or solicitation related to any product or service that is competitive with zapier products or services or (5) software or programs which contain any harmful code, including, but not limited to, viruses, worms, time bombs or trojan horses; (ii) impersonating another person; (iii) engaging in or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any city, state, national or international law or regulation, or which fails to comply with accepted internet protocol; or (iv) transmitting or transferring (by any means) information or software derived from the site or the service to foreign countries or certain foreign nations in violation of us export control laws.  in addition, you are prohibited from violating or attempting to violate the security of the site, the service or zapier’s system or network security, including, without limitation, the following: (w) accessing data not intended for users of the site or the service, or gaining unauthorized access to an account, server or any other computer system; (x) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures; (y) attempting to interfere with the function of the site, the service, host or network, including, without limitation, via means of submitting a virus to the site, overloading, “flooding”, “mailbombing”, “crashing”, or sending unsolicited e-mail, including promotions and/or advertising of products or services; or (z) forging any tcp/ip packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail or newsgroup posting. violations of the site’s or zapier’s system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.
