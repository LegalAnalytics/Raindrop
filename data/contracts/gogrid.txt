these terms of service form part of an agreement (this/the "agreement") between gogrid, llc, a delaware limited liability company, ("gogrid") and each customer of gogrid&rsquo;s services. in addition to these terms of service, this agreement consists of the following, each of which is incorporated into this agreement by this reference: gogrid's service level agreement, posted at http://www.datapipe.com/gogrid/legal/sla/ (the "sla"); gogrid's acceptable use policy, posted at http://www.datapipe.com/gogrid/legal/acceptable_use_policy/ (the "aup"); and gogrid's privacy policy, posted at http://www.datapipe.com/gogrid/legal/privacy_policy/ (the "privacy policy").
1.  services &amp; payment
1.1 services. gogrid will provide the services listed in customer&rsquo;s account (the &ldquo;services&rdquo;) pursuant to its standard policies and procedures then in effect. &ldquo;account&rdquo; refers to the record of services, features, and payment plans selected by customer and agreed to by gogrid, as they may change from time to time, all as recorded by gogrid in its online customer portal.
1.2 payment. customer will pay gogrid such fees as are required in customer&rsquo;s account. fee increases announced 30 or more days before the start of a new term (as defined in section 7.1 below) will go into effect at the start of such term. customer may use any credits gogrid issues to pay for services, except where this agreement provides to the contrary, but no credit will entitle customer to a refund. services fees, including overage fees where applicable, apply regardless of the cause of the services usage, even if caused by hacker activity or other third party actions. customer will pay for services pursuant to a pay-as-you-go plan or a prepaid plan, as listed in customer&rsquo;s account and described below; but additional offerings (as defined in section 1.3 below) and some other elements of the services may be billed separately from such plans, as set forth in customer&rsquo;s account.

 pay-as-you-go plans. if customer&rsquo;s account lists a pay-as-you-go plan, customer will pay for such services as it uses, and gogrid may charge fees hourly or daily (or at such times as it chooses).
 prepaid plans. if customer&rsquo;s account lists a prepaid plan, the provisions of this subsection 1.2(b) will apply.
customer will pay monthly or on such other prepayment period as is listed in customer&rsquo;s account. payment is due before the start of each prepayment period, including renewed prepayment periods, provided gogrid may instead charge part or all of prepaid plan services fees in arrears.
if customer&rsquo;s account provides for time or capacity limits, customer will pay overage fees in the event that it exceeds its limits, as calculated by gogrid pursuant to its standard policies, and gogrid may charge overage fees daily or at such times as it chooses.
if customer&rsquo;s account calls for a fixed number of servers or for time or capacity limits, customer may increase (&ldquo;upgrade&rdquo;) such server-count or limits at any time, subject to availability, through gogrid&rsquo;s customer portal. additional charges will go into effect upon upgrade, and gogrid may charge a prorated increase in services fees for the prepayment period during which the upgrade occurs, on a daily basis or at such times as it chooses.
additionally, if customer&rsquo;s account calls for a fixed number of servers or for time or capacity limits, customer may reduce (&ldquo;downgrade&rdquo;) such server-count or limits at any time through gogrid&rsquo;s customer portal, with new fees going into effect for the next prepayment period. gogrid is not required to provide a roll-over of services (memory, data, or servers) to a future month, a credit, or a refund in the event that customer downgrades or under-utilizes its services.
each prepaid plan will renew automatically at the end of its prepayment period for another prepayment period of the same duration. customer may cancel its prepaid plan 30 or more days before the next term, effective upon the start of such term. a cancelled prepaid plan will automatically become a pay-as-you-go plan pursuant to subsection 1.2(a) above (unless this agreement terminates).


1.3 additional offerings. "additional offerings" refers to: (a) consulting or other professional services provided by gogrid's staff, including by subcontractors providing services on gogrid&rsquo;s behalf; (b) software and other products and services customer acquires through gogrid exchange that are specifically designated "provided directly by gogrid"; and (c) any other services feature gogrid designates in writing an &ldquo;additional offering.&rdquo; the services will include any additional offerings listed in customer&rsquo;s account. in addition to the terms of this agreement, additional offerings are subject to any applicable statement of work or other agreement executed by customer and gogrid (&ldquo;additional offerings terms&rdquo;), each of which is incorporated into this agreement. additional offering terms may provide that they are not subject to amendment pursuant to section 8.2 below (amendment). additional offerings do not include third party offerings (as defined in section 4.2 below) or any services not providing services on gogrid&rsquo;s behalf and with gogrid&rsquo;s authorization.
1.4 account changes. other than the changes to services features and payments plans specifically authorized above by this article 1, any change to services features requires a written order submitted by customer (an &ldquo;order&rdquo;) and accepted in writing by gogrid. without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, server location, size (memory, ram, cpu), and operating system changes require an order accepted in writing by gogrid.
2.  services performance &amp; maintenance
2.1 sla. the sla applies to such services features as are described therein. credits and the other remedies provided pursuant to the sla are customer&rsquo;s sole remedies for the &ldquo;failures&rdquo; defined in the sla, unless the remedies in subsection 7.2 below (termination &amp; suspension for breach) are applicable. remedies listed in the sla do not apply to any services interruption authorized pursuant to section 2.2 below (maintenance) or pursuant to any other provision of this agreement, and gogrid will not be liable for any such interruption.
2.2 maintenance. gogrid may interrupt the services and/or access customer&rsquo;s data to perform maintenance on gogrid equipment or to address or mitigate the effects of security breaches and other interference by third parties. data gogrid accesses pursuant to the preceding sentence may include data stored in systems assigned to customer (referred to as &ldquo;hosted data&rdquo; in the privacy policy) and may include private or otherwise sensitive data.
2.3 system care by customer. customer will promptly report any services failure to gogrid via the online ticketing system in gogrid&rsquo;s online customer portal. customer is responsible for maintaining patches and disaster recovery systems, except to the extent gogrid specifically accepts such responsibilities by listing such services features in customer&rsquo;s account (subject to the limitations of liability in article 6 and elsewhere in this agreement).
2.4 services remedies in general. in addition to any applicable sla credits, gogrid will make reasonable efforts to recover data lost as a result of hardware failures, upon customer's request, but gogrid does not guarantee data recovery. gogrid is not responsible for providing physical access to or copies of software, data, or content stored on gogrid&rsquo;s equipment under any circumstances and is not required to provide network access (a) after any termination or suspension of services or (b) in the event of hardware failure, abuse by hackers or other third parties, or other interruption of network access. gogrid is not required to reimburse any expenses customer incurs for technology diagnosis or repair, including without limitation expenses for outside consultants.
3.  privacy &amp; security
3.1 gogrid responsibilities. in its handling of customer data, gogrid will observe the applicable terms of the privacy policy. the privacy policy applies only to the services and does not apply to any third party site or service linked to the services or recommended or referenced through the services or by gogrid&rsquo;s staff, including without limitation third party offerings (as defined in section 4.2 below). in addition, gogrid will exercise its best efforts to provide any data security features of the services included in customer&rsquo;s account (subject to the limits and disclaimers of liability in article 6 below).
3.2 customer responsibilities. customer is responsible for maintaining the security of its data, even if gogrid provides data security features of the services. regardless of any such features, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, customer will: (a) employ reasonable security precautions in its use of the services, including without limitation protection of passwords and login information, as well as encryption of social security numbers, other personally identifiable information protected by law, and information of similar sensitivity; (b) obey all applicable laws governing handling of third party data hosted or handled through the services; and (c) immediately notify gogrid of any unauthorized use of customer&rsquo;s services and any other security breach. customer is responsible for determining the services&rsquo; suitability for use with data regulated by the gramm-leach-bliley act, the european union&rsquo;s data privacy requirements, and other privacy-related laws and regulations, and gogrid is not responsible or liable for any incorrect determination. gogrid will have no responsibility or liability for losses resulting from customer&rsquo;s failure to maintain data security, including without limitation customer&rsquo;s breach of the requirements of this section 3.2.
3.3 hipaa protected health information. customer represents and warrants that, unless it and gogrid have executed a separate agreement authorizing customer to use the services to host &ldquo;protected health information&rdquo; (a &ldquo;business associate agreement&rdquo;), customer has not and will not upload or transmit to gogrid&rsquo;s computers any data regulated pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa), the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 (the hitech act), or any rule or regulation related to either of the foregoing (collectively, the &ldquo;hipaa laws &amp; rules&rdquo;). customer recognizes and agrees that, except as may be set forth in a business associate agreement, gogrid has no liability to customer for any failure to provide protections set forth in the hipaa laws &amp; rules.
4.  ip &amp; third party offerings
4.1 materials &amp; software.

service bureau &ndash; no ip license. customer recognizes and agrees that: (i) gogrid operates as a service bureau pursuant to this agreement, not as a vendor or distributor of software or other materials; and that (ii) this agreement does not grant customer any intellectual property rights or licenses, including without limitation licenses to software incorporated into or accessed through the services, to logos or trademarks associated with the services, or to other written or graphical content provided by or through the services (collectively, &ldquo;materials &amp; software&rdquo;). (however, additional offerings terms, as defined in section 1.3 above, may provide for a license.) gogrid retains all its right, title, and interest in and to the services, including without limitation all materials &amp; software. upon termination of this agreement, customer will relinquish all internet protocol (ip) addresses provided through the services.
open source &amp; other third party software. customer recognizes and agrees that the services may include access to software licensed to gogrid by third parties, and that some such third party software may have been provided under a copyleft or &ldquo;viral&rdquo; license intended to require use of open source licensing models by subsequent providers. without limiting the generality of the disclaimers set forth in section 6.1 below (warranty disclaimer), and without taking any position on the applicability of copyleft licenses to service providers, gogrid does not represent or warrant that software incorporated into the services will be free of copyleft or other restrictions on the use thereof, and gogrid makes no other warranties with regard to intellectual property rights in open source software or other software licensed to gogrid by third parties and accessible through the services.

4.2 third party offerings. "third party offerings&rdquo; refers to any product or service provided to customer by a third party, including without limitation: (a) third party consulting services that assist customer in using gogrid&rsquo;s services or that otherwise relate to the services, including such consulting services provided by third parties gogrid referred to customer; and (b) any and all software and other products and services customer acquires through gogrid&rsquo;s online application and service store, known as &ldquo;gogrid exchange,&rdquo; unless gogrid exchange specifically designates such product or service &ldquo;provided directly by gogrid.&rdquo; third party offerings are not part of the services (and are not materials &amp; software, as defined in subsection 4.1(a) above, or additional offerings, as defined in section 1.3 above). customer acquires third party offerings from those offerings&rsquo; third party providers and not from gogrid, pursuant to such agreements as customer and the third party providers may execute.
5.   customer responsibilities &amp; warranties
5.1 acceptable use. in its use of the services, customer will comply with the aup and applicable law. neither this agreement nor the aup requires that gogrid take any action against customer or any of its other customers for violating the aup or applicable law, but gogrid is free to take such action as it sees fit.
5.2 cooperation. customer will reasonably cooperate with gogrid to facilitate customer&rsquo;s receipt of the services. customer will also cooperate with any gogrid investigation of outages, third party interference, and security risks and incidents. customer will reimburse any reasonable legal fees or other costs gogrid incurs attempting to collect fees due.
